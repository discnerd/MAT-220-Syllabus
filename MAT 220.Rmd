##Course Description


Probability and Statistics is the study of randomness and identifying those changes that can be detected in spite of that randomness.  It also includes the design of investigations, visualization of results, and communication of those results.  



##Course Objectives

Students should:

1.	gain factual knowledge (terminology, classification, methods, etc.) in probability and statistics

2.	learn fundamental principles, generalizations, and theories in probability statistics

3.	learn to apply course material (to improve thinking, problem solving, and decision making)

4.	develop specific skills, competencies, and points of view needed by professionals in fields closely related to this course

</style>



1.  Students will learn multiple probability distributions, both discrete and continuous, and learn to use them in appropriate manners.

2.	Students will learn to calculate various statistics from a data set and what probability distributions they are related to. 

3.	Students will learn to draw conclusions about a data sets statistic based on the related probability distribution. 

4.	Students will learn different sampling and experimental methods and the mistakes and biases that occur in those processes. 

5.	Students will learn to use statistical software to present and use data in tabular, descriptive, and graphical forms. 

6.  Students will effectively communicate their analyses and results. 


#Assessment and Grading

##Homework

20% of the final grade - You are expected to complete homework by the time it is due.  Some homework will be assigned on WeBWorK and some on eLearn and is to be turned in to me, or my office by the time it is due.  This will usually be 7:30pm on Tuesday. (Outcomes 1-5)

##Quizzes
15% of the final grade - There will be a quiz on a weekly basis on the topics from the last homework assignment. (Outcomes 1-5)

##Project
20% of the final grade - You will work in groups of 3ish people to analyze data of your selection.  You will be required to create a report and make a presentation. (Outcomes 2-6 )


## Exams
25% of the final grade each - We will have two exams in this course. Each will include an in-class portion and a take-home portion. The take-home portion will be due on eLearn.   Failure to attend an exam will result in a zero on the in-class portion. (Outcomes 1-4,6)


## Math Culture
5% if the final grade - You are required to accrue at least 20 Math Culture points over the space of the semester.  More information about culture points can be found on eLearn. Culture points are intended to expose you to a broader and deeper scope of mathematics than is available in the courses offered at Loras.

#Policies

##Academic Dishonesty 

Please refer to the Loras College Academic Honesty Policy.  It can be found at <http://lorasedu.sharepoint.com/Academics/IQ/Documents/Academic%20Honesty%20Policy.doc>

##Learning Disabilities

In accordance with federal law, if you have a diagnosed disability or believe that you have a disability that might require reasonable accommodations, please feel free to discuss your needs with me at your earliest convenience.  Documentation of your disability must be on file with the Office of Disability Services (ODS), 120 Academic Resource Center, (563-588-7134) for you to receive accommodations. 

##Expectation for Class Attendance

You are expected to attend every class.  If you are going to miss class, email me beforehand.  Assignments will be given in class randomly.  Attendance will not be taken, but it will be obvious if you are not there. Note the policy for missed activities and exams.

##Withdrawal Date

The last day to add a semester-long course is Friday, February 1. The last day to withdraw from this class without a ‘W’ is Friday, February 15. The last day to withdraw with a grade of ‘W’ is Friday, March 22.
